//! Basic types for the blake2b chip.

/// This module holds types that exist across our code to explicitly state that a value is in a
/// given range. Everytime you see an AssignedBit, AssignedByte, AssignedBlake2bWord or AssignedRow,
/// you can be certain that all their values were range checked (both in the synthesize and in the
/// circuit constraints).
///
/// All these types are created in a context where its value has been constrained by a circuit
/// restriction to be in range.

/// Module for assigned bits.

/// Given a field element and a limb index in little endian form, this function checks that the
/// field element is in range [0, 2^64-1]. If it's not, it will fail.
/// We assume that the internal representation of the field is in little endian form. If it's
/// not, the result is undefined and probably incorrect.
/// Finally, it returns a [BigUint] holding the field element value.
